# plaYbox

The plaYbox is a recycled wooden box, with five buttons equipped with LEDs, used as a game for children.
I had this idea, when casually surfing the internet I came across these big buttons, and having already seen my daughter's interest (less than 2 years old) in playing with the bright (but dangerous) switches present in the house, I thought to use them to build a game.

The project has just started, and is evolving, ideas come to mind along the way, so keep following it if you want to be updated ...

In this video you can see the first test of buttons and leds.
